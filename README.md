# Regional Sales Analysis – Full Project

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze 5 years of U.S. regional sales data to uncover key business insights such as seasonal trends, product performance, channel profitability, and customer segmentation. The goal was to help decision-makers identify growth opportunities and optimize sales strategies through data-driven insights.

## Dataset Used

* Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx  - Raw master dataset containing sales, product, customer, region, and budget data across the U.S.
* Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv - Cleaned and transformed dataset used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* file.csv                     - Supplementary data used for mapping and preprocessing (e.g., state–region relationships).
* SALES REPORT.pbix	           - Power BI dashboard file for interactive visualization and real-time sales insights.
 

## Process
* Import Libraries: Load Python libraries for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* Load Dataset: Import multiple sales-related datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and merge tables.
* Feature Engineering: Create key metrics such as profit and profit_margin_pct.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify sales trends, revenue patterns, and correlations.
* Visualization: Create plots for regional, channel, and product performance.
* Dashboard Development: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for self-service analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
   • Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   
   • Power BI
   
   • Excel

## Insights
* Seasonality: Strong peaks in May–June; lowest sales in January.
* Top Products: Products 25 and 26 account for ~25% of total sales.
* Channel Mix: Wholesale leads with 54% of sales; Export channel offers the highest margins.
* Regional Trends: The West region dominates sales; Northeast needs performance improvement.
* Customer Impact: Aibox Company and State Ltd drive the largest revenue contributions.

## Conclusions
* Completed end‑to‑end EDA and interactive Power BI dashboard, surfacing seasonality, SKU, channel & regional insights.
* Insights inform sales policies and operational planning (store & warehouse prep aligned with annual trends).
* Stakeholders can self‑serve real‑time analysis and confidently onboard new datasets for additional use cases.
