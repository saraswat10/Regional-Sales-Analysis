# Regional Sales Analysis – Full Project

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze 5 years of U.S. regional sales data to uncover key business insights such as seasonal trends, product performance, channel profitability, and customer segmentation. The goal was to help decision-makers identify growth opportunities and optimize sales strategies through data-driven insights.

## Dataset Used

  # File Name	                               # Description / Purpose
  Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx	                Raw master dataset containing sales, product, customer, region, and budget data across the U.S.
  Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv                Cleaned and transformed dataset used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  file.csv                                    Supplementary data used for mapping and preprocessing (e.g., state–region relationships).
  Regional Sales Analysis Code.ipynb	         Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for EDA, data cleaning, and visualization.
  SALES REPORT.pbix	                          Power BI dashboard file for interactive visualization and real-time sales insights.
 

## Process
* Import Libraries: Load Python libraries for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* Load Dataset: Import multiple sales-related datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and merge tables.
* Feature Engineering: Create key metrics such as profit and profit_margin_pct.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify sales trends, revenue patterns, and correlations.
* Visualization: Create plots for regional, channel, and product performance.
* Dashboard Development: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for self-service analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
   • Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   • Power BI
   • Excel

## Insights
* Seasonality: Strong peaks in May–June; lowest sales in January.
* Top Products: Products 25 and 26 account for ~25% of total sales.
* Channel Mix: Wholesale leads with 54% of sales; Export channel offers the highest margins.
* Regional Trends: The West region dominates sales; Northeast needs performance improvement.
* Customer Impact: Aibox Company and State Ltd drive the largest revenue contributions.

## Conclusions
* Completed end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard uncovering seasonality, product (SKU), channel, and regional sales insights.
* Findings drive strategic decisions in pricing, promotions, and resource allocation — aligning sales policies and operational planning (e.g., store and warehouse readiness) with annual demand trends.
* The solution enables stakeholders to self-serve real-time insights, evaluate profitability across multiple dimensions, and seamlessly integrate new datasets for ongoing business analysis and forecasting.
